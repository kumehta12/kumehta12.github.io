                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Kunal Mehta, and I am currently a TPM at Microsoft on the Bing Ads Marketplace and Serving team. I am also pursuing a part-time Masters in Computer Science from Tufts University and recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara in Economics and Accounting, and Political Science. I am passionate about data and its application to optimizing business decisions and democratizing data analysis to those that do not have prior experience with it. On a personal note, I am a huge sports advocate whether that means watching on TV or playing the actual sport for countless hours. My goal is to continue to grow as a PM both technically and personally to help build products that will be characterized as easy to use and impactful in that specific space. </p>

                <h2>A fun fact about me</h2>
                <p>I have lived in both India and Singapore, each for only a year. I learned that the National Language of Singapore is called Singlish (No Joke). Both of those experiences allowed me to immerse myself in multiple cultures at a very young age. That experience has benefited me tremendously and I would not replace them! </p>
